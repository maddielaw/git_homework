Takeaways from Mod0 (so far):
  1. Being very detail-oriented is a major key to success! Carefully reading all instructions and notes on a subject first is vital.
  2. It is absolutely okay to ask questions when stuck -- nothing is gained by banging your head against a wall in silence for longer than needed.

  Strategies to try in Mod0:
  1. Keeping up with the review-preview model for my notes and upcoming sessions. This has been super helpful so far and I want to keep that habit going before and after each session.
  2. I want to get more comfortable with playing around with code and trying things. When I find myself wondering "what will happen if I try this thing," I want to try that thing and see what happens.
